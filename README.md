#  Smart Anti-Overflow Manhole System with Flow Diversion and Blockage Management using Real-Time IoT
 # Problem Statement
 Urbaning communities report to see an increase in what we may term local flooding
 which is a result of manhole overflows from blockages, sediment accumulation and also
 from poor drainage maintenance. Presently we see that which which we term traditional
 systems do what they can which is to do manual inspections and wait for issues to become
 critical before they react which in large part is too little too late. Also we see that present
 wireless solutions have issues with range, reliability and energy efficiency and that the
 cloud based systems’ performance breaks down at key times like heavy rain which in turn
 causes loss of connection. There is a very present need for a which we may term a real
 time and autonomous monitoring system that which is able to detect the early signs of a
 blockage, to predict overflow issues and to take preventative action even in the absence
 of a network.
 # Overview
 The project outlines a smart manhole monitoring and overflow prevention system for
 urban flood management. This system design integrates real-time sensors, machine
 learning, and hydraulics to identify, predict, and prevent manhole overflows. The
 system architecture comprises flow, depth, pressure, and turbidity sensors, which are
 real and replica nodes designed for blocked system robustness testing. Sensor data is
 sent to a cloud dual-layer machine learning system and is analyzed for trend detection
 and flood risk prediction. This is accomplished using a Heltec ESP32 LoRa-based hub.
 To as we see in the case of cloud outages which are a common feature of severe
 weather the network also includes a local AIML module as a part of the hub. This
 edge fallback system does trust scoring, sensor fusion, anomaly detection, and short term
 forecasting which in turn enables autonomous operation during disconnections. We use
 solenoid valves which the hub controls for dynamic flow diversion which in turn prevents
 overflows. The solution is scalable, cost effective and puts into play in today’s smart city
 infrastructure.
# Purpose
 This project is to develop what we have designed as a smart and reliable manhole
 monitoring system which is to identify and put an end to urban flooding caused by
 manhole overflows. We are to use IoT sensors, real time data analysis, and machine
 learning to do early detection of blockages and which in turn will enable us to do
 automatic flow diversion thus which in turn reduces infrastructure damage, traffic
 disruptions and public health risks. Also we are to present a cost effective, scalable and
 resilient solution which will run continuously even during network failures which makes
 it a perfect fit for modern smart city infrastructure.
# Scope
 This project we are designing, developing and deploying an intelligent manhole monitoring
 system which will use IoT, LoRa communication, and Machine Learning. We will have
 real time sensing of flow, depth, pressure, and turbidity; wireless data transfer; cloud
 based prediction models; and an edge solution for when out of the range operation. Also
 we will be including hydraulic control via solenoid valves for active flow diversion. This  solution is to scale for wide area urban deployment, will adapt to many different drainage
 systems, and is put forth for predictive maintenance and flood prevention in smart cities.
